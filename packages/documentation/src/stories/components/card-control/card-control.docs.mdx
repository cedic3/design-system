# Card-Controls
<p className="lead">For a more specialized visualization of checkbox and/or radio elements.</p>

<Canvas of={CardControlStories.Default} />
<Controls of={CardControlStories.Default} />

## Installation

The `<post-card-control>` element is part of the `@swisspost/design-system-components` package. For more information, read the
<LinkTo kind="getting-started-components" story="docs">getting started with components guide</LinkTo>.

## Examples

### Custom icon

You can use our built in icons by just adding the `icon` property with the name of the desired icon.<br/>
If this is not enough, you can also use the `icon` slot and add your very own custom icon.

<div className="alert alert-md alert-info">If you use the `icon` slot, make sure you remove all the `width` and `height` attributes from the `img` or `svg` tag. Otherwise we can not ensure, our styles will work properly.</div>

<Canvas of={CardControlStories.CustomIcon} />

### With content

The component accepts other HTML-elements as its content, this includes also other form elements.

<Canvas of={CardControlStories.Content} />

### Lined up

Change the width of a `<card-control>` component, by putting it (for example) in a grid.

<Canvas of={CardControlStories.LinedUp} />
<div className="hide-col-default">
  <Controls of={CardControlStories.LinedUp} />
</div>

### Radio button group

As you can create radio button groups with native `<radio>` elements, you can do the same with our `<post-card-control>` component as well.<br/>
Just add the same `name` attribute value to multiple `<post-card-control type="radio">` components.

<Canvas of={CardControlStories.RadioGroup} />
